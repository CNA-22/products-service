# Image Hosting Comparison 

### Storing images in MongoDB

It is possible to store images in MongoDB but not recommended. If we choose to do so the limit is 512MB including the rest of the data the products take up in the database.
This approach would further require that we use image resizing and heavy compression. For example [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp). [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) allows compression of 500 images/mo for free.




### Free tier specs of image hosting CDNs with APIs

The most professional approach would be to store static assets and file uploads in something like AWS S3.
