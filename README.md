## Development

The `products-service` is implemented as a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) server that persists data in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance. The source code is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework as its "backbone". [`mongoose`](https://mongoosejs.com/) is used for interacting with the database.

### Local Development Environment

Developing and testing the service locally is really easy. All you need to do is run `docker compose up` in the repo directory, granted you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed (see [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if you're using macOS or Windows).

The local development environment is powered by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and defined in the [`docker-compose.yaml`](docker-compose.yaml).

Basically the setup consists of two services (Docker containers) being run in parallel:

#### 1. `mongo`

A container that hosts a MongoDB instance. The container is based off the default [MongoDB image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo).

The actual database "data" lives on a volume that is mounted to `./db` right in the repo directory. (The `./db` directory is gitignored for obvious reasons.) Removing the `./db` directory will reset the MongoDB instance, which can be useful when developing.

#### 2. `api`

A container that runs the `products-service` directly from the source code, using [`ts-node-dev`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node-dev). The source code is accessed through a volume that mounts the repo's `./src` directory inside the container. `ts-node-dev` watches the source code for changes and restarts the service when changes are detected.

This container is based on a custom image that is defined [here](Dockerfile).

## Deployments

All deployments consist of a Heroku Node.js Dyno that runs the `products-service` server and a MongoDB Atlas cloud database.

### Staging Deployment

Deployed from [`staging`](https://github.com/CNA-22/products-service/tree/staging) branch.

### Production Environment

Deployed from [`main`](https://github.com/CNA-22/products-service/tree/main) branch.
